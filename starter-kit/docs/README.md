## üìñ Documentation Types

### 1. **Chat Archives** (`chat-archives/`)
**Purpose**: Preserve Cursor AI chat sessions for context restoration  
**Format**: Markdown files with date prefix  
**Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

**What to Include**:
- Session overview (date, focus, status)
- Features implemented
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Issues encountered and solutions
- Code changes and file locations
- Git commit references
- Performance metrics
- Future considerations

**When to Create**:
- After completing major feature work
- Before losing chat history
- At end of significant development sessions

### 2. **Changelog** (`CHANGELOG.md`)
**Purpose**: Quick reference for "what changed when"  
**Format**: Reverse chronological (newest first)  
**Sections**: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed

**Update When**:
- Deploying to production
- Completing feature milestones
- Making breaking changes
- Fixing critical bugs

### 3. **Decision Records** (`decisions/`)
**Purpose**: Document architectural and technical decisions  
**Format**: ADR (Architecture Decision Record)  
**Naming**: `001-decision-title.md`, `002-next-decision.md`

**Template**:
```markdown
# Decision: [Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status**: Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated

## Context
What is the issue we're trying to solve?

## Options Considered
1. Option A - pros/cons
2. Option B - pros/cons
3. Option C - pros/cons (chosen)

## Decision
What did we decide and why?

## Consequences
What becomes easier/harder as a result?

## Implementation
Files changed, code references, commands to run
```

## üîç How to Use This System

### Scenario 1: Chat History Lost
1. Open `docs/chat-archives/`
2. Find most recent session file
3. Read "Session Overview" and "Features Implemented"
4. Reference "Files Modified" to understand code changes
5. Check `CHANGELOG.md` for quick feature summary

### Scenario 2: Why Was This Decision Made?
1. Check `decisions/` folder for ADRs
2. Search by topic (e.g., "Why media_files table?")
3. Read "Context" and "Decision" sections
4. Understand trade-offs in "Consequences"

### Scenario 3: What Changed Recently?
1. Open `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Review entries from newest to oldest
3. See file locations and commit hashes
4. Cross-reference with git: `git show [commit-hash]`

### Scenario 4: New Developer Onboarding
1. Start with `CHANGELOG.md` for overview
2. Read recent chat archives for detailed context
3. Review decision records for architectural understanding
4. Check `development_documentation/` for technical guides

## üìù Contributing to Documentation

### After Major Features
1. Create chat archive in `chat-archives/`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes
3. Create decision record if applicable
4. Commit docs with code changes

### Naming Conventions
- **Chat archives**: `2025-10-01-feature-name.md`
- **Decisions**: `001-decision-title.md` (numbered)
- **Use lowercase with hyphens** for filenames

### Keep It Updated
- Document as you build (not after)
- Include "why" not just "what"
- Reference file paths and line numbers
- Add code snippets for complex changes
- Link related documentation

## üí° Tips for Effective Documentation

### For Chat Archives
‚úÖ **DO**:
- Include exact error messages
- Reference specific file paths and line numbers
- Document performance before/after metrics
- List all files changed
- Include git commit hashes
- Explain "why" decisions were made

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Copy entire file contents (reference line numbers instead)
- Include sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Write vague descriptions ("fixed some stuff")
- Forget to update CHANGELOG

### For Decision Records
‚úÖ **DO**:
- Explain the problem context
- List alternatives considered
- Document trade-offs
- Update status if decision changes
- Reference related decisions

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Skip the "why" (most important part)
- Make decisions in isolation
- Forget to communicate to team
- Leave outdated decisions without status update
