## 💾 Backup Strategy

### Primary: Git Repository
All chat archives are committed to git, so they're:
- ✅ Version controlled
- ✅ Backed up on GitHub
- ✅ Accessible from any machine
- ✅ Searchable via `git log` and `git grep`

### Secondary: External Archive
Consider also saving to:
- Notion/Obsidian for searchability
- Team wiki for collaboration
- Google Drive for redundancy

---

## 🏷️ Archive Naming Convention

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

Examples:
- ✅ `2025-10-01-media-library-implementation.md`
- ✅ `2025-10-15-inventory-system-design.md`
- ✅ `2025-11-03-performance-optimization.md`

❌ Avoid:
- `chat.md` (not descriptive)
- `oct-1.md` (hard to sort)
- `media_library.md` (no date)
