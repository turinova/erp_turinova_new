# Chat History: Kereső (Search) Feature Implementation

**Date**: January 28, 2025  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Feature**: Real-time Material Search System

## Initial Request
User requested a new page called "Kereső" with URL `/search` that should:
- Search in materials and linear_materials tables
- Display results in a table with specific columns
- Show pricing information with VAT calculations
- Be lightning fast with real-time search

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Basic Page Setup
1. **Created page structure**:
   - `/search/page.tsx` - Server-side component
   - `/search/SearchClient.tsx` - Client-side component
   - Added to database pages table
   - Added to navigation menu

2. **Menu Integration**:
   - Added as main navigation item
   - Positioned as second item after Home
   - Used search icon with red color

### Phase 2: Search API Development
1. **Created `/api/search/route.ts`**:
   - GET endpoint for search queries
   - Searches materials table by name
   - Searches linear_materials table by name
   - Returns combined results with brand and VAT data

2. **Initial Issues**:
   - Complex `.or()` queries with joins caused SQL errors
   - Fixed by simplifying to name-only searches
   - Split materials search into separate queries for performance

### Phase 3: Client-side Implementation
1. **SearchClient.tsx Features**:
   - Real-time search with 300ms debouncing
   - Loading indicator during search
   - Dynamic results table
   - Price calculations with VAT

2. **Price Calculations**:
   - Fm ár: `price_per_m * (1 + vat)` for linear materials
   - Nm ár: `price_per_sqm * (1 + vat)` for materials
   - Egész ár: Total price calculations for both types

### Phase 4: UI Enhancements
1. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Added colored chips for material types
   - Blue chips for linear materials
   - Red chips for materials (changed from purple)
   - Highlighted price columns with background colors

2. **Price Formatting**:
   - Added thousand separators using Hungarian locale
   - Format: `1 000 000 Ft` instead of `1000000 Ft`
   - Applied to all price columns

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Optimization
1. **Null Safety**:
   - Fixed crash when materials had null brands
   - Added `item.brands?.name || '-'` for safety
   - Updated TypeScript interfaces

2. **Performance**:
   - Simplified search to name-only for speed
   - Added proper error handling
   - Optimized database queries

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: SQL Query Complexity
**Problem**: Complex `.or()` queries with joined tables caused "Internal Server Error"
**Solution**: Split into separate simple queries for materials and linear materials

### Challenge 2: Null Brand Crashes
**Problem**: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')` error
**Solution**: Added null safety with optional chaining and fallback values

### Challenge 3: Search Scope
**Problem**: User wanted name-only search for better performance
**Solution**: Removed brand and type searches, focused on name field only

### Challenge 4: Visual Design
**Problem**: Purple chips looked awful
**Solution**: Changed to red chips for better visual appeal
