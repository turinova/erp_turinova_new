## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Add Bulk Action Buttons
1. Imported icons: `Check`, `DoneAll`, `Delete`
2. Imported `PaymentConfirmationModal` from Scanner
3. Created `DeleteConfirmationModal` component
4. Added state: `paymentModalOpen`, `deleteModalOpen`, `isUpdating`
5. Added bulk actions box with 3 buttons
6. Added conditional rendering (only when orders selected)

### Phase 2: Payment Confirmation Integration
1. Created `handleFinishedClick()` function
2. Checks for unpaid orders
3. Shows payment modal or updates directly
4. Created `handlePaymentConfirmation()` callback
5. Integrated with existing payment modal component

### Phase 3: Delete Confirmation Modal
1. Created `DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx` component
2. Added warning alert
3. Added explanation of what happens
4. Created `handleCancelClick()` function
5. Created `handleDeleteConfirmation()` callback

2. Fetches `quote_payments` for all orders
3. Calculates `total_paid` per order
4. Calculates `remaining_balance` per order

## Bug Fixes

### Issue 1: Remaining Balance Not Available
**Problem:** Order interface didn't have `total_paid` or `remaining_balance`

**Solution:** 
- Updated server to fetch payment totals
- Calculate `total_paid` and `remaining_balance` server-side
- Added fields to Order interface
- Modal now displays accurate remaining balances

### Issue 2: Browser Confirm Dialog
**Problem:** Using `window.confirm()` for delete confirmation (not professional)

**Solution:**
- Created proper Material-UI modal component
- Added warning alert
- Added detailed explanation
- Professional UI matching the rest of the app

### Issue 3: Button Not Defined
**Problem:** `Button` component not imported

**Solution:** Added `Button` to Material-UI imports
