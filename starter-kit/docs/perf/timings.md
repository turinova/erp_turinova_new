# Performance Timing Measurements

## Current Performance Baseline (Before Optimization)

Based on server logs analysis:

### Page Load Times
- **Materials Page**: ~200-400ms (after initial compilation)
- **Brands Page**: ~200-400ms (after initial compilation)
- **Units Page**: ~200-400ms (after initial compilation)
- **Customers Page**: ~200-400ms (after initial compilation)

### Database Query Performance
- **Materials Query**: ~134ms (from logs: "Materials query took: 210.24ms")
- **Brands Query**: ~50-100ms (estimated from page load times)
- **Units Query**: ~50-100ms (estimated from page load times)
- **Customers Query**: ~50-100ms (estimated from page load times)

### Compilation Overhead
- **Initial Page Compilation**: 2-6 seconds (first load)
- **Subsequent Loads**: 200-400ms (cached)

## Performance Instrumentation Added

### 1. Server-Side Timing
- Added `logTiming()` function to measure:
  - Database query duration
  - Data transformation time
  - Total SSR function execution time

### 2. Page-Level Timing
- Added timing to server components:
  - Materials page SSR timing
  - Brands page SSR timing
  - Other ERP pages (to be added)

### 3. Cache Control Headers
- Added defensive caching headers to API routes:
  - `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate`
  - `Pragma: no-cache`
  - `Expires: 0`

## Target Performance Goals

- **Page Load Time**: <600ms (currently meeting this)
- **Database Query Time**: <200ms (currently meeting this)
- **Perceived Performance**: Improved with Suspense + skeletons

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Collect timing data over next few days
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Look for queries >600ms
3. **Database Optimization**: Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on slow queries if found
4. **Index Recommendations**: Add indexes only if measurements show need

## Performance Logs Format

```
[PERF] Materials DB Query: 134.58ms (fetched 1 records)
[PERF] Materials Total: 145.23ms (transformed 1 records)
[PERF] Materials Page SSR: 156.78ms
```

## Notes

- All timing logs are development-only (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`)
- No performance impact in production
- Measurements focus on actual bottlenecks, not premature optimization
