# Chat History - Supplier Orders Search & Pagination Fixes
## Date: October 17, 2025 - 18:40 CEST

### Session Summary
Fixed critical issues with the supplier orders page search functionality and pagination system. The main problems were SSR errors, incorrect pagination, and limited search capabilities.

### Key Issues Resolved

#### 1. Server-Side Search Error
**Problem**: `getAllShopOrderItems` function was causing SSR errors when trying to filter data server-side.
**Error**: `Error: [ Server ] [SSR] Error fetching shop order items: {}`

**Solution**: 
- Converted from server-side filtering to client-side filtering
- Updated `SupplierOrdersPage` to fetch all items without filters
- Removed server-side search parameters from URL handling

#### 2. Pagination Not Working Correctly
**Problem**: User reported "26 records now if set to only show 10 only 1 page is showing also the filter count is modify to 10 which is not correct"

**Root Cause**: Pagination was using server-side `initialCurrentPage` and `initialLimit` props, causing incorrect page counts and filtering.

**Solution**:
- Added client-side `currentPage` and `pageSize` state management
- Implemented proper pagination calculation: `Math.ceil(filteredItems.length / pageSize)`
- Added page reset when search or status filters change

#### 3. Search Functionality Limited
**Problem**: Search was not working properly and couldn't search in partner names.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced search to include: `product_name`, `sku`, `customer_name`, `partner_name`
- Implemented client-side filtering with case-insensitive matching
- Added proper search result count display

#### 4. Status Filter Counts Incorrect
**Problem**: Status filter counts were calculated from server-filtered data instead of all items.

**Solution**:
- Status counts now calculated from full `items` array
- Client-side status filtering applied after search filtering
- Proper count display for filtered vs total results

### Technical Changes Made

#### Files Modified:
1. `src/app/(dashboard)/supplier-orders/page.tsx`
2. `src/app/(dashboard)/supplier-orders/SupplierOrdersClient.tsx`
3. `src/app/(dashboard)/customer-orders/[id]/CustomerOrderDetailClient.tsx`

#### Key Code Changes:

**Client-side State Management**:
```typescript
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1)
const [pageSize, setPageSize] = useState(50)
```

**Enhanced Search Filtering**:
```typescript
const matchesSearch = 
  item.product_name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  item.sku.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  item.customer_name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  item.partner_name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
```

**Fixed Pagination Logic**:
```typescript
const totalPages = Math.ceil(filteredItems.length / pageSize)
const startIndex = (currentPage - 1) * pageSize
const paginatedItems = filteredItems.slice(startIndex, startIndex + pageSize)
```

**Page Reset on Filter Changes**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setCurrentPage(1)
}, [searchTerm, statusFilter])
```

### Additional Enhancement
**Worker Name Display**: Added colored chip display for worker names using worker color from database in customer order detail page.

### Testing Results
- ✅ **26 records with page size 10** = **3 pages** (10, 10, 6)
- ✅ **Status filter counts** show correct numbers
- ✅ **Search works** across all fields including partner names
- ✅ **Pagination resets** to page 1 when filtering
- ✅ **No SSR errors** on page load

### User Feedback
- "server is running properly but the pagination doesn't work correct because there is 26 records now if set to only show 10 only 1 page is showing also the filter count is modify to 10 which is not correct don't mess the fucking server because it is running properly"

### Resolution
All issues were successfully resolved. The supplier orders page now works consistently with the customer orders page, providing proper search functionality, accurate pagination, and correct status filtering.

### Performance Benefits
1. **Faster Search**: No server round-trips for search
2. **Better UX**: Instant filtering and pagination
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Matches customer orders page functionality
4. **Reduced Server Load**: Single data fetch, client-side processing
